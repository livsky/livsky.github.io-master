            <p>We are a group of four girls students at
              <a href="http://www.mdx.ac.uk/">Middlesex University</a>. We have been very excited about creating our first webpage based on our 8 week coding course!</p>
            <p> Evelina, Olivia, Patrycja and Romilly welcome you to the world of Antarctica. We have decided to design our website based on this unique continent as we all love animals and the fascinating nature of this part of the planet. </p>
            <p>Thanks to Codefirst: Girls we have been given an amazing opportunity to learn how to code and this is the fruit of our work. Enjoy! </p>

                <h3> Penguins</h3>
                   Penguins are sea-birds in the family Spheniscidae. They use their wings to 'fly' underwater, but they cannot fly in the air. They eat fish and other sea food. Penguins lay their eggs and raise their babies on land. They are at home in the ocean.

          <h3> Seals </h3>
                Seals only spend around half of their time in water as the other half is spent on land. There are thought to more than 30 different species of seal found in the world's cooler waters. Predators of the seal include polar bears, sharks and even humans who hunt the seals mainly for their oil but also for food.

          <h3> Whales </h3>
              Whales are huge, but elusive and difficult to see which adds to their mystery and fascination. They are highly intelligent animals with an elaborate social life Whales are mammals. This means that they are not fish. They breathe air and so must return to the surface at regular intervals to get a breath.

            <h3> Arctic Foxes </h3>
            This fox can live in the cold north even when it is -30F. The Arctic fox eats any meat it can find. The pups are born with brown fur and as they grow older it turns white.
            Predators: Polar bears, wolverines, red foxes and golden eagles.

            <h2>❄Climate❄</h2>
            <p>Antarctica is the coldest continent on earth, and has a climate of extremes. The continent is snow and ice-covered, with freezing temperatures all year round. So-called "Catabian winds" can cause violent snowstorms that can last for days, and sometimes even weeks, making it very dangerous to stay outside.</p>
            <p>Antarctica's lowest air temperature record was set on 21 July 1983, with −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) at Vostok Station. Satellite measurements have identified even lower ground temperatures, down to −93.2 °C (−135.8 °F) at the cloud free East Antarctic Plateau on 10 August 2010.</p>

         <h2>Life</h2>
          <p>The people who travel to or live in Antarctica fall into two main groups, those who live and work on scientific research stations or bases, and tourists. No-one lives in Antarctica indefinitely in the way that they do in the rest of the world. It has no commercial industries, no towns or cities, no permanent residents.
				Antarctica does not and has never had an indigenous population. Antarctica is therefore one of the few places in the world that can truly be described as having been discovered. It has one airport, but apart from that it is uninhabited long-term by humans due to its weather and climate</p>
